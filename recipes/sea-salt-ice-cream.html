    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Blue ice cream you eat with your homies after working for a nefarious organization
        in order to feel like a person.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Be in a "zombie" like state due to having been born, quite literally, yesterday</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Cup of cream</li>
        <li>2 Friends, because if you don't, who else will you eat ice cream with?</li>
        <li>1 Tall ass clock tower in which to sit atop</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp of Cornstarch</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup of sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tsp of sea salt</li>
        <li>Trauma stemming from not knowing who you are</li>
        <li>Teal gel-based food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together 1 ½ cups each of high quality milk and cream. </li>
        <li>Realize you're a clone of somebody else.</li>
        <li>Spiral.</li>
        <li>Combine 3 Tbsp cornstarch in about 1 cup of milk and cream mixture until it is dissolved and no lumps remain.</li>
        <li>Bring the remaining milk and cream mixture close to a simmer on the stovetop. </li>
        <li>Then, ¾ cup sugar is added directly to the milk and cream on the stovetop until it dissolves over medium-low heat until just simmering. </li>
        <li>At this point you will add the cornstarch mixture until combined. Let that all cook for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add one heaping tsp of sea salt to custard on stovetop as it finishes thickening. Then strain into a heat-proof bowl. Add some gel-based teal food coloring.</li>
        <li>Make sure not to kill your friend who is slowly turning into the person you're a clone of. </li>
        <li>Into an ice cream machine it goes for about 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
    </ol>
